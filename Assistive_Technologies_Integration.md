# Assistive Technologies Integration

Assistive technologies can reduce barriers to literacy and concept formation for learners with diverse needs. The focus here is on practical, research-aligned supports that can be integrated into learning tools, curricula, and classroom workflows without overwhelming students or educators.

The capabilities below highlight common integration points for AI-enabled supports, with an emphasis on measurable outcomes such as reading fluency, writing independence, and conceptual understanding.

## Key Capabilities

- Speech recognition and text-to-speech help learners with reading or writing difficulties by enabling oral input and auditory feedback.
- Predictive text and AI-driven spelling correction support dyslexic learners through reduced cognitive load and improved writing confidence.
- Visual aids and interactive simulations help learners with autism or cognitive delays better grasp abstract concepts through concrete, multimodal representation.

## Implementation Notes

- Prefer configurable settings (rate, voice, vocabulary, hint density) to accommodate individual education plans.
- Provide clear on/off toggles and transparency cues so learners understand when assistance is active.
- Log usage and outcomes in a privacy-respecting way to guide iterative improvements.
